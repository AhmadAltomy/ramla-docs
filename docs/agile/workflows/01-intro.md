# Workflow Introduction

The workflow is a set of statuses that an issue can go through during its lifecycle. The workflow is important because it helps the team to understand the current status of the issue and what needs to be done next. The workflow also helps to standardize the process that the team will follow to complete the issue.

In this section, we will define the workflows for each issue type and define the workflow schemes that will be used in the project.
