# Estimation Strategy

The estimatioon strategy we are use is based on the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence goes as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.

## Story Points Estimation

### Estimation Scales

The story points estimation is based on the Fibonacci sequence

- 0: No work required
- 1: Very small task
- 2: Small task
- 3: Medium task
- 5: Large task
- 8: Very large task
- 13: Extra large task

### How to Estimate

When estimating a task, the team should consider the complexity, effort, and risk of the task. The team should discuss the task and come to a consensus on the story points.

### Steps to Estimate

1. **Discuss the Task**: The team should discuss the task and understand the requirements.
2. **Estimate the Task**: The team should estimate the task based on the complexity, effort, and risk.
3. **Come to a Consensus**: The team should come to a consensus on the story points for the task.

### Example

Let's take an example of estimating a task:

- Task: Implement a login feature
- Complexity: Medium
- Effort: Medium
- Risk: Low
- Story Points: 3
- Reasoning: The task is of medium complexity and effort, and the risk is low. Hence, the story points are 3.
- Consensus: The team agrees on the story points for the task.
- Note: The story points are not based on the time taken to complete the task but on the complexity, effort, and risk involved.

### Tips for Estimation

- **Relative Estimation**: The team should estimate the tasks relative to each other.
- **Consensus**: The team should come to a consensus on the story points.
- **Re-estimate**: If the team feels that the estimation is incorrect, they can re-estimate the task.
- **Use the Fibonacci Sequence**: The team should use the Fibonacci sequence for story points estimation.
- **Use the Estimation Scales**: The team should use the estimation scales for story points estimation.

Keep in mind that the estimation is not an exact science, and it is okay to make mistakes. The team should learn from the estimations and improve the estimation process over time.

## Story Points Table for Reference

| Story Points | Complexity       | Effort            | Risk      | Description      |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| 0            | No work required | No work required  | No risk   | No work required |
| 1            | Very small task  | Low effort        | Low       | Very small task  |
| 2            | Small task       | Low effort        | Low       | Small task       |
| 3            | Medium task      | Medium effort     | Low       | Medium task      |
| 5            | Large task       | High effort       | Medium    | Large task       |
| 8            | Very large task  | Very high effort  | High      | Very large task  |
| 13           | Extra large task | Extra high effort | Very high | Extra large task |

| Task                                | Complexity | Effort | Risk | Story Points |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ---- | ------------ |
| Implement a login feature           | Medium     | Medium | Low  | 3            |
| Implement a registration feature    | Medium     | Medium | Low  | 3            |
| Create a new table in the dashboard | Small      | Low    | Low  | 2            |

## Guidelines

### Complexity Definition Guidelines

When estimating the complexity of a task, the team should consider the following guidelines:

- **Very Small Task**: A very small task is a task that can be completed in a few hours.
- **Small Task**: A small task is a task that can be completed in a day.
- **Medium Task**: A medium task is a task that can be completed in a few days.
- **Large Task**: A large task is a task that can be completed in a week.
- **Very Large Task**: A very large task is a task that can be completed in more than a week.

Also, the complexity of the task can be influenced by factors such as dependencies, risks, and unknowns and if it UI/UX task or backend APIS we can define that with the following examples:

#### UI/UX Task

- **Very Small Task**: A very small task is a task that involves changing the color of a button.
- **Small Task**: A small task is a task that involves adding a new section to the dashboard.
- **Medium Task**: A medium task is a task that involves redesigning the login page.
- **Large Task**: A large task is a task that involves redesigning the entire dashboard.
- **Very Large Task**: A very large task is a task that involves redesigning the entire application.

#### Backend Task

- **Very Small Task**: A very small task is a task that involves adding a new field to the database.
- **Small Task**: A small task is a task that involves creating a new API endpoint.
- **Medium Task**: A medium task is a task that involves integrating a third-party service.
- **Large Task**: A large task is a task that involves refactoring the entire database schema.
- **Very Large Task**: A very large task is a task that involves migrating the entire application to a new server.

### Effort Definition Guidelines

When estimating the effort required to complete a task, the team should consider the following guidelines:

- **Low Effort**: Low effort is required when the task is straightforward and does not involve complex logic.
- **Medium Effort**: Medium effort is required when the task involves some complexity and logic.
- **High Effort**: High effort is required when the task involves a significant amount of complexity and logic.
- **Very High Effort**: Very high effort is required when the task involves a large amount of complexity and logic.
- **Extra High Effort**: Extra high effort is required when the task involves an extremely large amount of complexity and logic.
- **No Effort Required**: No effort is required when the task is trivial and can be completed without any effort.

### Risk Definition Guidelines

When estimating the risk associated with a task, the team should consider the following guidelines:

- **Low Risk**: Low risk is associated with tasks that are well understood and have been completed before.
- **Medium Risk**: Medium risk is associated with tasks that have some unknowns and may require additional research.
- **High Risk**: High risk is associated with tasks that have significant unknowns and may require experimentation.
- **Very High Risk**: Very high risk is associated with tasks that have a high degree of uncertainty and may require a significant amount of experimentation.
