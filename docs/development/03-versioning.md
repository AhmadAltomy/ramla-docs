# Versioning and Release Strategy

We will be using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for versioning our project. Semantic Versioning is a simple set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented.

## Versioning Scheme

The version number is composed of three parts: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- **MAJOR**: Incremented when you make incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR**: Incremented when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
- **PATCH**: Incremented when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
- **Pre-release**: A pre-release version is denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot-separated identifiers immediately following the patch version.
- **Build metadata**: Build metadata is denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of dot-separated identifiers immediately following the patch or pre-release version.
- **Examples**: `1.0.0`, `2.3.1`, `1.0.0-alpha.1`, `1.0.0+20130313144700`.
- **Versioning Example**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.0.0`).
- **Pre-release Example**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-rc.1` (e.g., `1.0.0-rc.1`).

## Versioning and Release Workflow

The versioning and release workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Create a Release Branch**: Create a release branch from the `develop` branch with the version number (e.g., `release/1.0.0`).
2. **Update the Version Number**: Update the version number in the project configuration files (e.g., `package.json`, `pom.xml`).
3. **Update the Changelog**: Update the changelog with the new features, bug fixes, and changes.
4. **Create a Pull Request**: Create a pull request from the release branch to the `master` branch.
5. **Review and Merge**: Review the changes, ensure that the version number is correct, and merge the pull request.
6. **Tag the Release**: Tag the release with the version number (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
7. **Publish the Release**: Publish the release to the package registry or distribution platform.
8. **Merge Back to Develop**: Merge the release branch back into the `develop` branch.
9. **Update the Version Number**: Increment the version number in the project configuration files for the next release.
10. **Repeat the Process**: Repeat the process for each release.
